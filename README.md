# Clustering

The code implements a basic K-means clustering algorithm from scratch and then comparing it with the K-means clustering implementation provided by scikit-learn. Let's break down what is happening in the code:

Generating Synthetic Data: make_blobs function is used to create synthetic data with 500 samples, 5 clusters, and 5 features (n_samples=500, centers=5, n_features=5).
The data is stored in arrays X and y.

Data Visualization: The code uses matplotlib to create a scatter plot of the generated data points in the X array. Each point is colored according to its cluster label (y).
A separate scatter plot is created for the initial cluster centers, marked with red triangles.

K-means Clustering Initialization: The code initializes the number of clusters (k=5) and a list of colors for visualizing the clusters.

Creating Cluster Dictionaries: A dictionary called 'clusters' is created to store information about each cluster, including its center, associated data points, and a unique color for visualization. 

Random Initialization of Cluster Centers: For each cluster (k), initial cluster centers are randomly generated within a specific range. 

Assigning Data Points to Clusters (E-step): The assign_clusters function calculates the distance of each data point to the cluster centers and assigns each data point to the cluster with the nearest center.

Updating Cluster Centers (M-step): The update_clusters function calculates the new cluster centers by taking the mean of the data points belonging to each cluster.

Plotting Clusters: The plot_clusters function plots the data points for each cluster with their associated color and the updated cluster centers as black triangles.

Comparison with Scikit-Learn K-Means: The code then switches to using scikit-learn's KMeans implementation to perform K-means clustering on the same dataset. It fits the KMeans model on the data and extracts the cluster centers and labels. It creates a scatter plot of the data points, coloring them based on their true labels, and marks the cluster centers as black triangles.


In summary, the code first implements a basic K-means clustering algorithm from scratch, assigns and updates cluster centers, and visualizes the results. Then, it uses scikit-learn's KMeans to perform clustering on the same dataset for comparison.
